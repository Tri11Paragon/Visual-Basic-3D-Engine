# Visual-Basic-3D-Engine
just a 3d visual basic engine im working on in class instead of doing actual work

-- This is an old school project.
If you found this because you also are forced to do a project in VB / C# and want to use OpenGL, then I would suggest the OpenTK library. 
My final project, which is completed and works is found at: https://github.com/Tri11Paragon/Legacy-3D-Visual-Basic
